Paper 13:

Lets say our aim is to maximize the following ratio (accuracy of network/time taken to design) for a given neural network designing task. Which approach leads to maximization of this ratio?


options

a) Fast search for better architecture using random weights with no training.
b) Selecting a random architecture with unsupervised pretraining and finetuning. 
c) Fast search for better architecture using random weights with training(say 10000 iterations).
d) None of the above


Answer
option a



Paper 14:

Which of the following is not True

options

a) Switch-Curriculum is a less powerful option to improve the network as there is a possibility that network might lose some of the concepts learned upto that moment(i.e when switching happens). 
b) Anti curriculum strategy might perform worser than non regularize network.
c) The performance of curriculum dropout strategy is loosely attributed to the fact that overfitting caused by excessive co-adaptations of neurons appear only after a while in the learning process. 
d) All of the above are True.

Answer

option d
