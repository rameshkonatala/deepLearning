Paper 15:

Which of the following is not True

options

a) The pooling layers in a CNN reduce resolution of input feature maps.
b) In the Scattering Network the choice of local and global invariances are tailored to the type of images specifically.
c) Pre-training on larger datasets provides a better starting point for learning as it provides knowledge about properties inherent to all natural images.
d) In RFNN polynomials upto infinite order are considered as higher order basis functions contain deeper visual information. 

Answer

option d


Paper 16:
