Paper 10:

Which of the following is not True?


options

a) Residual networks enable very deep networks.
b) While it is observed that error might increase as we increase no. of layers in case of a conventional neural network, residual networks might mitigate this problem when no. of layers get too deep. 
c) It is observed that the paths through the residual network that contribute gradient during training are longer than expected
d) It is observed that removing residual modules mostly removes long paths.


Answer
option c
