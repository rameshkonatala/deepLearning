Paper 8:

Why is a Spatial Transformer Network preferred for classification of images?


options

a) To reduce the geometric variations inside the data
b) Traditional CNN´s are not invariant to larger transformations
c) As it transforms data to a normalized space expected by the subsequent layers
d) All of the above

Answer

option d



Paper 9:

If we use a traditional CNN for semantic segmentation the output is found to be coarse? Which reason best suits this phenomenon

options

a) The CNN´s cannot support only image classification but not semantic segmentation.
b) Max pooling destroys information in CNN thus inducing coarseness in the output for semantic segmentation.
c) The output dimensions of network are gradually reduced by subsampling causing coarseness in the semantic segmentation.
d) None of these

Answer

option c
