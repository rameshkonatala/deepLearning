Paper 1:

Which of the following statements is not true

options

a) Deep learning networks make use of convolution so that property of 'translational invariance' is captured
b) Deep learing  methods are transparent i.e, human users will be able to understand how a given deep learning system made a given decision. 
c) Deep learning systems are less accurate when test set data varies significantly with train set data
d) Unsupervised learning can be achieved without labelled data

Answer

option b

Deep learning methods are not transarent enough at this stage.
